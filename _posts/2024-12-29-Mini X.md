## Challange
A cybercriminal responsible for a series of high-profile ransomware attacks has vanished. The only remaining clue is a fragmented NCIC number hidden within the investigation's scattered files. A corrupted image, found on a dark web server, is believed to be linked to the suspect, who is rumored to be on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Your mission is to reconstruct the NCIC number. Flag Format: 0xL4ugh{WXXXXXXX59}

## What we have? 
- We have an unusable image:

- The NCIC Code must start with 'w' and end with '59'.

## What did i do: 
I adjusted the gamma and saw more in the image, which helped me recognize that it shows a person wearing a jacket.

After that, I decided to search for the most wanted cyber suspects. It only took about 15 minutes to look through the list. I checked to see if the NCIC numbers ended with '59'. The first person I found with that ending was `Sajjad Tahmasebi`, but he is not the suspect, as his image did not match the description of wearing a turtleneck sweater.

After searching a bit longer, I found `Alexsey Belan`, who had the correct image.

With this, I was able to obtain the complete NCIC number and, therefore, get the correct flag.
Flag: `0xL4ugh{W507648159}`
